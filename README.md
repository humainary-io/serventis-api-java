## Description

The Humainary Initiative is dedicated to revolutionizing the engineering of complex systems by
championing three core principles: sensibility, simplicity, and sophistication.

Our mission is to empower engineers and organizations to build, operate, and evolve systems that are
not only highly observable and adaptable but also intuitive and resilient in the face of increasing
complexity.

The future of observability is all about creating new toolkits, instruments, and taxonomies that let
us understand how systems work at various scales and across state spaces.

## Serventis

Serventis is a semiotic-inspired observability framework designed to provide structured sensing and
sense-making for distributed systems.

It defines a contract for monitoring system states and service interactions through a standardized
language of signals and assessments, enabling adaptive intelligence without enforcing a specific
implementation.

Serventis consists of:

- **Monitors API** – Tracks the operational condition of services, assessing state transitions with
  confidence levels.

- **Services API** – Captures service-to-service interactions using structured signals and
  orientations, based on signaling theory and social system regulation.

- **Reporters API** – Defines the interface contract for reporting situational assessments.

- **Probes API** – Provides a structured framework for monitoring and reporting communication
  outcomes in distributed systems.

By separating observation from interpretation, Serventis enables the integration of agents, machine
learning models, and scorecards, allowing for context-aware reasoning and autonomous situational
awareness.

It is a foundational layer for intelligent observability, supporting distributed coordination,
adaptive control, and multi-perspective analysis.
